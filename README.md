# Hollow-sun

This program will ask the user to input their choice (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, or 3 for Scissors). It then generates a random choice for the computer. The program will compare the choices and determine the winner based on the rules of the game. Finally, it will display the computer's choice, the player's choice, and the result (whether the player wins, the computer wins, or it's a tie).
